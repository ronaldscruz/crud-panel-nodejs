# CRUD Panel NodeJS
An simple admin panel in with NodeJS and EJS just to learn NodeJS + Mongoose + Express basics. Directories aren't well organized because it's an "old" project

## How to run
It doesn't have any production version, so, after installing MongoDB, you only need to install dependencies and you will be able run.
```
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

# CRUD Panel NodeJS
An simple admin panel in with NodeJS and EJS just to learn NodeJS basics
Directories aren't well organized because it's an "old" project

## How to run
This project doesn't have any production version, so you just need to install dependencies and run!
```
  npm install
  npm run dev
```
